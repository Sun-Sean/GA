A-: Good job overall. Some limitations noted below.

## ease of accessing package, help, tests:

Good. 

## main help page (select):

Good overall, including examples. No real description of algorithm.

## quality of user interface (function arguments, flexibility):

Should have a default for population size.

Good flexibility in terms of selection type.

No way to specify family for glm, so can only do logistic regression.
No way to suppress verbose printing.

## performance on my tests:

performance on baseball known: finds best model
performance on baseball full: finds a good model but not the best
performance on big-p: Finds an ok model, but not near the best.

## testing

Tests pass, but lots of warnings.

Tests focus on expected output format without testing of correctness of calculation or any testing of performance.

## writeup (including examples):

Nicely presented. Main limitation is that in your examples you do not assess performance relative to best model or (if simulated) true model.

## code efficiency

A bit slow on small examples, probably partly due to reaching max number of iterations.
Very slow on my big GLM example.

## code organization/clarity/elegance:

Easy to follow and code is concise. 

init_parents is not used.
Some assertions in helper functions, but probably better placed in main function.

All zero models are fine.

You assume the best model is in the last generation, but it could have occurred in a previous generation.

## code comments/formatting:

Good.

## parallelization:

None

## equality of workload:

Good
